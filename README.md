# Wind power production data
These [data](./data/TimeSeries_UTC_kWh_2022_all.csv) comes from [NVE](https://www.nve.no/media/14352/timeseries_utc_kwh_2022_all.zip) and contains data about wind power production and wind speeds from Norwegian wind parks since from 2003 until 2021.
More info possibly [here](https://www.nve.no/energi/energisystem/vindkraft/produksjonsrapporter/).
In general, these datasets might consist of estimates (for years where there are no production data), based on some regional climate models for locations within the wind farm.
